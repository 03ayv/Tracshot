        TracShot was born from a group of passionate students tasked with creating a startup for our Business Development course. As shooting enthusiasts and tech innovators, we saw a challenge: too much time spent calculating scores manually instead of focusing on precision and improvement.

        Our mission? To revolutionize the shooting experience with smart technology. TracShot uses AI and advanced analytics to instantly process your targets, giving you real-time feedback, accuracy insights, and performance trends—so you can train smarter, not harder.

        What started as a class project has grown into something bigger: a tool designed to make sports shooting more efficient, precise, and data-driven. Join us in redefining the way shooters track their progress. TracShot – Your Personal Shooting Coach.
